Langsmith Course Assignment for MAT496

## Lesson 1

Learned: Gained hands-on experience instrumenting Python functions with the @traceable decorator to build a hierarchical run tree. This approach is key for tracking custom logic and achieving end-to-end observability in a Groq-powered RAG pipeline using LangSmith.

Tweak: Enhanced the tracing setup by assigning meaningful names and attaching contextual metadata to the core RAG functions, resulting in richer and more informative trace logs.
